An (interactive?) theorem prover for Bedwyr

After experimenting with the PCMC implementation for model checking it is clear
that its logic (muFa) is much too weak to assist in proving theorems. A stronger
kernel is thus necessary, and here we attempt to furnish one such system.

Here we will play the role of Culhwch to Bedwyr, which will assist us in
completing the "impossible tasks" that lie ahead.
